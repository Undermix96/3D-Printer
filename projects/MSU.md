|PTFE tubing<br/> PC4-M10<br/> PC4-M6|![enter image description here](https://i.postimg.cc/FzggY8XH/image.png)|these type of kits include everything you will need(and much more with the new merger) and are the best value|0.5m<br/>1 pcs<br/>1pcs|
|5mm to 5mm coupler|![enter image description here](https://i.postimg.cc/yxv34Hzc/image.png)|In a last resort situation you can opt of the flexible 5 to 5 couplers that are more commonly available, but definitely replace it with a solid coupler ASAP|1|
|Metal rod 5mmx124mm (a little longer won’t cause any problems and you will have a hard time finding a rod exactly to size)|![enter image description here](https://i.postimg.cc/mDVghy6G/image.png)|Following links are for a D shaft, basically a rod with one side machined in order to be able to easiely secure and mount the gears. (making a D shape, hence the name)<br/>Similar results can be optained by using a dremel to flatten the rod at each set screw position|2|
|MK8 gears with filament groove|![enter image description here](https://i.postimg.cc/m2WTRqrF/image.png)||5|
|Nema 17 stepper motor|![enter image description here](https://i.postimg.cc/tJ3QYqgn/image.png)|Needed for direct drive or if original extruder doesn't use a regular sized NEMA 17 stepper motor|1|
|Servo|[![616z-Elw-Ukz-L-AC-SL1001.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/Dydk3RVc/616z-Elw-Ukz-L-AC-SL1001.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/3dRbgSxy)|You might also need a coupler if it's not included. </br></br>Make sure your servo has 270 degrees of range or more (anything above 200 should work but current setup is being developed and tested with a servo that has 270 deg of range), and make sure that is is not a continuous servo (be careful when looking at 360 degree servos because these tend to be continous)|1|
|Idler springs|![idler springs](https://i.postimg.cc/RVdy8bJm/image.png)|You will want to choose 10mm length 0.9mm wire diameter and 5mm outer diameter|2|
| | | [**Direct drive version**]<br/>for the direct drive version you will only need one extra stepper motor, see NEMA 17 stepper above[**/Direct drive version**]||
| | |[**Direct drive version linked extruders**]<br/>for this version you will also need  the extra stepper driver but also a stepper motor splitter linked below[**/Direct drive version linked extruders**]||
